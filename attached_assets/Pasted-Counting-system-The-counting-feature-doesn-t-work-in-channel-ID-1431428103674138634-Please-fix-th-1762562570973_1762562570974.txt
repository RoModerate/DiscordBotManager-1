Counting system:

The counting feature doesn’t work in channel ID 1431428103674138634. Please fix the logic so it counts correctly, adds the ✅ mark for correct counts, and handles mistakes properly (5 chances, 5-second cooldown).

AI Chat:

When I ping the bot, it says “AI chat is currently disabled.”

Please fix this so the built-in AI works and responds in chat like a normal conversational AI. It should respond to pings and questions naturally.

/config command:

Even after I configure everything, it still says:

❌ Ticket category not configured. Please contact an administrator.


Fix the configuration saving system so it correctly stores and reads category and permission settings.

Redesign the /config UI using Discord markdown and gray buttons with clear labels like:

> Next, > Previous, > Reload, > Submit

Make sure there are no bugs or missing permissions.

!ticketpanel command:

Redesign the panel using Discord markdown and this improved message format:

> **Notice**

>
> ✦ These guides will help you understand the process and following them will significantly speed up the handling of your ticket.

When a user selects a ticket type:

It should open a private ticket channel under the correct category.

Channel name format:

🟢 | @User → when claimed

🔴 | @User → when unclaimed

Ping the staff and the user.

Ask for “Reason for opening” via a modal UI when the ticket is created.

When closed, send a transcript to channel ID 1420538005936013403 with the staff name who handled it.

General notes:

Please fix all command issues so both / and ! versions work properly.

No duplicate messages, no missing embeds, no emoji spam — just clean markdown formatting.

Make sure everything runs smoothly without any bugs or errors.
