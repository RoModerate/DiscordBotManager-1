✅ When a user selects an option → the bot should create a ticket channel under the correct category.

🧷 Ticket Channel Format

Channel name format:
《🔴》・username (when not claimed)
《🟢》・username (when claimed)

Only the ticket creator and ticket managers should see the channel.

🧾 Ticket Embed (Inside Channel)

When ticket is created:
Embed at the top of the ticket should look like this:

> Ticket opened by @user  
> Reason:


Then show the user’s provided reason in a code block:

Reason: example text here


Extra details:

Add user’s Roblox avatar as a thumbnail on the embed.

Add their Roblox username (clickable link) in the embed footer or a separate field.

Example:

Roblox Profile: Click Here

👤 Claim System

When a staff member claims a ticket:

The bot should not reply with text.

Instead, edit the top embed to add:

> This ticket has been claimed by @user


Change the channel name to show “🟢”.

❌ Close Ticket System

Fix the “This is not a valid ticket channel.” issue — closing must work in all valid ticket channels.

When a ticket is closed:

Send the transcript automatically to 1420538005936013403.

Include the staff name and user in the transcript header.

🤖 AI Chat System

Fix the issue where it says:
AI chat is currently disabled.

Make the AI respond normally when pinged (e.g., when someone mentions the bot).

Ensure /aisetup actually enables the AI and saves the config.

Add short-term memory so it remembers the last few messages in the conversation.

The AI should also work in ticket channels if allowed.

🧱 Level System Fix

Currently stuck at Level 3 — fix progression.

Levels should increase as users send messages.

Example rule:

~20 messages → Level 1

~40 messages → Level 2

~60 messages → Level 3, and so on.

When a user levels up, send a message to channel ID 1409304816718709006:

@user has reached Level {X}! Keep chatting to earn more levels!


Don’t use embeds for level-up messages — keep it simple text.

⚙️ General Requirements

All embeds and messages must be clean, consistent, and use Discord markdown.

No duplicate messages or spam replies.

Bot should send embeds only when necessary.

Everything should function bug-free and optimized for performance.
