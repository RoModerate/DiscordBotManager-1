Spiritual Battlegrounds — AI Moderation System Setup

This setup adds two key systems to the AI:

Shift Tracking (Start / End)

Staff Management (Promotion / Infraction)

Shift Tracking System
1. shift start
Command: shift start [duration]


Purpose: Begins a moderation shift.
The AI logs when a moderator starts their shift and tracks how long they’ll be active.

Example Usage:

!shift start 2h


When used:

The AI confirms the shift start with a success message.

It notes who started the shift, when it began, and the expected duration.

The AI saves this information and automatically knows who is currently on duty.

Shift Start Log Channel:

2. shift end
Command: shift end


Purpose: Ends the moderator’s current shift.
When the shift ends, the AI calculates total time spent and sends a summary log.

Example Usage:

!shift end


AI Log Details:

Moderator name

Shift start and end time

Total duration

Optional notes if added automatically or manually

Shift End Log Channel:

<#1436895129615995060>

Staff Management System
3. promotion
Command: promotion [@user] [new rank]


Purpose: Used to promote staff members to higher ranks.
Only Owners, Co-Owners, Managers, or High Staff can use this command.

AI Action:

Promotion Log Channel:

<#1436895147206901810>

4. infraction
Command: infraction [@user] [reason]


Purpose: Logs a rule violation or staff infraction.

Example Usage:

!infraction @Member Misuse of mod commands


AI Action:

Sends a clear, formatted log to the Infraction Channel

Notes who issued it, who received it, and the reason

Infraction Log Channel:

Example Log Entry:

User: @Member
Reason: Misuse of mod commands

AI Functionality Notes

The AI should:

Accept commands only from valid staff roles (Owner, Co-Owner, Manager, or other authorized ranks).

Track and store shift start/stop data cleanly, without duplicates or errors.

Use plain text (not embeds) for logs and updates.

Be able to learn or be taught new actions or responses if needed in the future.

Avoid bugs such as false shift detection or logging mismatches.
