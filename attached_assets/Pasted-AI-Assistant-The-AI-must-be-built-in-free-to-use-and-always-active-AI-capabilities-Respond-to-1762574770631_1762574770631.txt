AI Assistant

The AI must be built-in, free to use, and always active.

AI capabilities:

Respond to users’ queries directly in text, no unnecessary embeds.

Support /teach and !teach:

Users can train the bot.

The AI remembers the training permanently.

Example: !teach @Bot if a user wants to report a player, it must be done in #support → the bot must enforce this rule correctly in the future.

Context retention:

Remember Roblox usernames, Discord IDs, categories, roles, and server structure.

Avoid repeating previous questions incorrectly.

Respond intelligently in tickets:

Suggest staff involvement if necessary.

Ask for STOP/START commands to pause/resume conversation.

Provide accurate information only.

For suggestion and bug channels:

Suggestion channel (1409310962103877752) → forward useful suggestions to 1436559543139045437 with user icon.

Bug report channel (1409311252400050196) → log appropriately.

AI should analyze user activity to determine contributions by role or user for reporting purposes.

5. Counting System

In channel 1431428103674138634:

Users count from 1 → 5000.

Maximum 5 mistakes per user.

5-second cooldown between messages.

Add checks for correct sequence.

Provide messages like “please wait before typing” if cooldown is active.

Remove Spanish messages, all instructions in English only.

6. Level-Up System

Track user activity and increment levels correctly:

Display: @user is now Level 1, then Level 2, Level 3, etc.

Levels increment based on message activity.

Announcements go in channel 1409304816718709006.

Use plain text, no embeds.

7. Command Management

/config and .config:

Owner can configure who can use commands and which roles.

Buttons: Next, Previous, Reload, Submit

Manage ticket categories, verification, AFK commands, and AI settings.

Must be error-free, display useful error messages if misconfigured.

Commands to implement:

.say / /say → bot repeats message.

.AFK / /unAFK → manage AFK status.

/giveaway → basic giveaway functionality.

8. Role-Based Permissions

Commands and utilities must be restricted based on roles:

Trial Moderator: Warns, Timeout (1383270277147787294)
Junior Moderator: Kick + Trial Mod perms (1409873374288674816)

9. General Notes

The bot must join voice channels when required.

No duplicate messages for any command or system.

Professional appearance in all embeds, select menus, and button interactions.

Keep everything simple, reliable, and intuitive for users.

Ensure AI is robust, fully integrated, and handles tickets, counting, level-ups, and marketplace actions.

All bugs from previous systems must be eliminated.

Focus on smooth, polished UX and clear Discord formatting.
