1. Command Duplication & Performance Fix

Fix the issue where commands (like ! or /) cause duplicate responses. The bot should respond only once to each valid command.

Add a cooldown system (e.g., 2 seconds per user per command) to prevent spam.

Ensure that all command prefixes are unified — use both:

Dot prefix (e.g. .say, .purge, .config)

Slash commands (e.g. /say, /config, /giveaway)

Commands should be case-insensitive (e.g., .Say or .say both work).

2. Ticket System (Complete Redesign)

Goal: Create a clean, professional ticket system inside a single category where all tickets open.

Category: Main Ticket Section
Channel IDs:

Claim Channel → 1409304816718709006

Staff Ping ID → 1383270362707656774

Ticket Setup Flow:

When a user types /ticket or .ticket, open an embedded UI panel with the following header message:

Notice:
If this is your first time using our ticket system, please read the guide below.

These guides will help you understand the process. Following them will help us handle your request faster and more effectively.

Allowed Tickets:
- User Reports
- Staff Reports
- Bug Reports
- Warning Appeals
- Content Creator Requests
- Other Server-Related Inquiries

Disallowed Tickets:
- General Game Questions
- Suggestions
- Role Requests (Staff, Tester, Helper, etc.)


Below the message, create a dropdown (selection menu) with the following options:

Support Ticket

Request CC

Report a Member

Warning Appeal

When a user selects an option:

A new ticket channel is created under the ticket category.

The channel name format:

ticket-s-username → Support

ticket-r-username → Report

ticket-w-username → Warning

ticket-cc-username → Content Creator Request

Send a message in that new channel tagging staff (<@1383270362707656774>) with:

Ticket created by @user.
Please provide a detailed reason for opening this ticket.


Add a text input box for the user to type their reason.

Add a Claim Button for staff to mark tickets as “claimed.”

When claimed, show a green check beside the ticket name.

If unclaimed, show a red X beside the name.

Only the staff who clicked “Claim” can mark it as “Resolved.”

Once closed, tickets should auto-archive after 24 hours or when the staff resolves it.

3. Verification System

Fix the /setupverify command (currently broken).

Channel ID for verification: 1423669807521202247

The system should allow the server owner to run /config verify and set:

The verification channel

The verified role

Optional welcome message

When a user verifies, send a DM confirming:
"Verification complete! You now have access to the server."

4. Leveling & XP System

Add a leveling system that tracks user activity in text channels.

When a user levels up, send this message:
@user is now level {level}! Keep chatting to earn more levels.

Include cooldown to prevent message spam farming.

5. Utility Commands (Dot + Slash Versions)

Add the following commands with both . and / versions:

Command	Description
.say / /say	Makes the bot repeat a user’s message.
.purge / /purge	Deletes a selected number of messages.
.config / /config	Opens configuration panel for admins to set up IDs, logs, etc.
.dm / /dm	Sends a DM to a chosen user.
.giveaway / /giveaway	Creates a giveaway with customizable time, prize, and winner count.

Make /config interactive with embeds and select menus (for server setup, verification, logging channels, etc.).

6. Counting System (Fun Game System)

Category ID: 1431428103674138634
Goal: Users must count correctly up to 5000.

Rules:

Each user must wait 5 seconds between numbers.

If a user types too early, reply with:
Please wait before typing again.

If they type the wrong number, they lose 1 of 5 chances.

After 5 mistakes, they are locked from counting for 1 hour.

When a user types the correct number, add a ✅ reaction.

If the count reaches 5000, send a special message:
"Congratulations! The count reached 5000!"

7. Welcome System

Category ID: 1409299795318804612
When a new user joins, send:
Welcome @user to (server name)!
Add optional custom messages or random greetings for variety.

8. Bot Presence & Design

Set status to Do Not Disturb with custom message:
"Managing RoModerate Systems"

Use clean embedded messages for all system responses.

Include timestamps and consistent color themes for embeds.

Ensure all user avatars in embeds display properly using interaction.user.displayAvatarURL()

9. Future Expansion (Optional Ideas)

Add a dashboard link in /config so users can manage settings from the website version.

Create an admin-only channel for moderation logs and ticket actions.

Add database caching so tickets, verification states, and levels persist across restarts.
