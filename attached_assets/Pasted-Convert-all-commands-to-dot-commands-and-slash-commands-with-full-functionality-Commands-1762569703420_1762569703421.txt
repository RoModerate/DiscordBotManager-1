Convert all ! commands to dot commands (.) and slash commands (/) with full functionality.

Commands like .setupverify, .ticketpanel, /config, .say, .purge, /giveaway must work without bugs.

/config must allow the owner to configure:

Who can use each command

Which role has access

Ticket categories and AI functionality

Buttons: Next, Previous, Reload, Submit (all properly working, gray professional style)

Counting system must work: messages increment levels properly, with a cooldown (5 sec) between messages, and mistakes reduce chances (5 chances).

.setupverify must only have:

Gray Verify button

Blue Need Help button → redirects to support channel (1389999965979283608)

On verify: DM user → > Verification Complete. You have successfully verified in @server

Embed DM shows user’s Roblox name and icon

Log the verification in 1411710143598690404

2. Ticket System

!ticketpanel must:

Use select menu (no buttons)

Categories:

Support ticket → 1436498409153626213

Request CC → 1436498445216256031

Report player → 1436498495153635512

Warning appeal → 1436498528544227428

Channel name: 《🟢》 @user if claimed, 《🔴》 @user if not claimed

When opened: ask reason in a UI and log it in the ticket

Embed ticket includes user’s Roblox icon and clickable link

Staff and user are pinged when ticket is created

Transcript is sent automatically to 1420538005936013403 when ticket is closed

Close button must prompt for reason and send transcript

Make the design professional with Discord markdown (>, **, ), no emojis in text

3. AI Functionality

AI should respond to tickets depending on the issue:

Can handle ticket questions automatically

Ask if ticket should be closed when resolved

STOP → AI stops responding

START → AI resumes from where it left

/aisetup must activate AI

AI should not respond in embeds, respond as normal text in the ticket

Support /teach and !teach commands so users can teach the AI:

Example: !teach @bot claim ticket automatically → AI learns and performs that action
