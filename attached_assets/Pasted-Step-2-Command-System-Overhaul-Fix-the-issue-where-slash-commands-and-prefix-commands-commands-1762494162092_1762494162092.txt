Step 2 — Command System Overhaul

Fix the issue where slash commands and prefix commands (. commands) don’t respond or show up.

Ensure all commands are registered properly with Discord’s API on startup.

Add a reload command (/reload or .reload) to refresh all commands without restarting the bot.

Commands must work for both formats:

Prefix = .command

Slash = /command

Fix issue where .setupverify deletes itself or vanishes — make the bot send persistent messages that stay in chat until deleted by staff.

Step 3 — Verify System Fix

Channel ID for verification: 1423669807521202247

The command /setupverify or .setupverify should create a persistent embed like:

Welcome to the server!
Press "Verify" below to gain access.


Add a button labeled Verify

When pressed, give the user the “Verified” role and send them a DM confirming success.

Make sure the embed does NOT delete automatically after sending.

Add permissions so only admins can run /setupverify.

Step 4 — /config Redesign

Remove the “Coming Soon” message.

Create a full /config command that opens an interactive embed panel with dropdowns for:

Setting the log channel

Setting the ticket category

Setting the verification channel & role

Setting the welcome message

Setting the counting channel

Each dropdown should let the admin update values instantly.

Store all configurations in the bot’s database so settings persist after restarts.

Add a confirmation message:
✅ Configuration saved successfully!

Step 5 — Ticket System Fix

Fix the current broken ticket panel and redesign it:

Ticket categories:

Support Ticket

Report a Member

Warning Appeal

Content Creator Request

Each ticket should create a private channel visible to the user + staff.

Add buttons for:

Claim Ticket

Close Ticket

Claim adds a green ✅ next to the channel name.

Closing auto-archives the channel after 24h.

Add logs for ticket creation and closure in the configured log channel.

Make sure the ticket creation panel does not vanish or delete automatically.

Step 6 — Countdown System Fix

Add a countdown timer that works properly (no freezing or desync).

Let admins start a countdown via /countdown [time] [message].

The message should update every minute showing remaining time, then say “Countdown complete!” when done.

Step 7 — Counting Channel Fix

Channel ID: 1431428103674138634

The bot should automatically track the counting game there:

Start from 1

If someone types the wrong number, reply: ❌ Wrong number, try again.

If someone types twice in a row, reply: ⚠️ Wait your turn.

Add cooldown and persist last number in the database.

When 5000 is reached, send a congrats embed.

Step 8 — General Improvements

Make sure no embed or config message disappears automatically unless deleted manually.

All embeds should use a consistent clean design with color #5865F2 (Discord blue).

Add error handling: if something breaks, the bot sends an error message instead of crashing.

On startup, send a console log confirming:

✅ Bot is online and connected.
✅ Slash commands loaded.
✅ Prefix commands loaded.
✅ Joined Voice Channel 1418915825716559884


Remove all “Coming Soon” or placeholder features.

Step 9 — Debugging Checklist

Before completion, test and confirm that:

.setupverify and /setupverify work correctly.

/config runs and saves data.

.ticket and /ticket create and manage tickets correctly.

Countdown works without bugs.

Counting system functions without crashing.

Bot joins voice channel automatically and stays connected.

No command deletes or disappears unless the user removes it.
