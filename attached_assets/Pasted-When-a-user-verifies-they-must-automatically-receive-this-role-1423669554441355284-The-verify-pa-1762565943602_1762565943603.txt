When a user verifies, they must automatically receive this role: 1423669554441355284.

The verify panel should only show two buttons:

Gray Verify button (verifies the user).

Blue Need Help? button that redirects to channel: 1389999965979283608.

Remove any embed text like “Click the button below to verify…”

When a user verifies, send a DM saying:

Verification Complete!
You’ve been successfully verified in @servername.
Also show their Roblox username, avatar, and send a log of that info to channel: 1411710143598690404.

AI System:

The AI chat system does not work. Replace it with a free AI API that actually responds fast and realistically (not just generic generated text).

Example free API: https://www.apifreellm.com/docs

Make /aisetup properly enable the AI and respond to pings normally.

Ticket System:

Completely redesign !ticketpanel with proper Discord markdowns like **bold**, code, and code blocks for a clean design (no emojis in the description text).

Add a select menu with these exact labeled emojis next to their names:

Support Ticket → <:7452jijiquestion:1412831191098327070> → Category ID: 1436498409153626213

Request CC → <:7502kintaimmensementalfortitude:1412831174752997386> → Category ID: 1436498445216256031

Report a Member → <:82674shrimpalerted:1412831155404800061> → Category ID: 1436498495153635512

Warning Appeal → ⚠️ → Category ID: 1436498528544227428

Ticket channels must be named like this:

Unclaimed: 《🔴》username

Claimed: 《🟢》username

When claimed, send an embed (not a normal message) that says:

This ticket has been claimed by @user.

Include an embed field showing
Reason: <user's input>

Display the user’s Roblox avatar (small) on the embed’s side, with a clickable link.

When a ticket is closed, ask for a closing reason and automatically send a transcript to: 1420538005936013403.

Counting Channel:

Counting channel: 1431428103674138634

Fix it so it actually reacts to correct counts with ✅ and tracks mistakes (max 5 allowed).

Remove Spanish completely.

Level System:

Level up messages should start from Level 1 and increase based on activity.

Send level-up messages (text only, no embed) in channel: 1409304816718709006.

Welcome System:

Fix the welcome system — it’s not triggering at all.

When a user joins, send a message in 1409299795318804612 saying:

Welcome @user to @servername!

/Config Command:

Redesign /config fully:

Use clean gray Discord markdown buttons only (Next, Previous, Reload, Submit).

Owner should be able to assign which role can use each command.

Must save and update settings properly (no more “❌ Ticket category not configured” errors).

/Logs Command:

Add a /logs command that shows recent moderation actions and system events.

Overall Fixes:

No duplicate messages anywhere (especially during verification).

Fix any “This is not a valid ticket channel” or “interaction failed” errors.

Keep the bot status on Do Not Disturb.

Optimize all code to ensure no lag, no crashes, no double responses, and fast execution.
