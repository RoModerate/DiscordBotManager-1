SPIRITUAL BATTLEGROUNDS™: BOT & SERVER CONFIGURATION BRIEF

Use this spec to guide your custom agent and Replit AI builds. All details are targeted for modular, scalable, and maintainable configuration—do not delete or modify anything unless instructed.

Main Objectives
Build a custom Bloxlink-style verification system, using API key: 454b00db-82ce-4c2e-b5ae-3f3a27b02e72

Add two UI buttons in the channel for users:

Verify (gray)

Can’t Verify (blue)

No button text; simple UI, aligned horizontally

On pressing Can’t Verify, user is redirected to: support channel (id: 1389999965979283608)

On Verify, bot performs Roblox-Discord account linking via Bloxlink API (see documentation for API call structure, access permissions, and error handling)

Discord Server Essential Features and Recommended Bots
Verification Bot (Custom, replaces Bloxlink for direct API integration)

Moderation Bot (Dyno, Carl-bot, or Sapphire for mod logs, automod, anti-raid, warnings)

Ticket System (Custom panel, open/close/config support, panel in #support)

Role Management Bot (Self-assign roles, integration w/ Roblox groups)

Activity/XP Bot (e.g., Arcane, Sapphire for leveling, activity tracking)

Welcome Bot (Automated welcome DM and rules link upon joining)

Invite Tracker Bot (Track invites for server growth stats)

Server Configuration Tasks
Channels & Roles Audit

Review all channels (rules, welcome, important, information, content, voice, etc.) for purpose and permissions.

Map each channel’s core function (rules, help, dev logs, staff, general, tickets, etc.)

Set channel READ permissions for all, POST only for roles above Member in critical channels.

Ensure bots have Manage Roles, Read Messages, Send Messages, Manage Webhooks, Manage Channels.

Roles Needed

Verified

Staff / Moderator

Admin

Developer

Contributor

Support

(Unverified if required for gating new users)

Grant Verified upon successful Roblox verification.

Assign custom panel to Support channel for tickets.

Custom Ticket Panel Example

text
[TICKET PANEL]
> Welcome to support. Click the button below to open a ticket.
[Open Ticket] [Close Ticket]
Panel auto-closes ticket after inactivity.
Panel logs all tickets to #panel-logs with user and problem.
Config variables:
   - support_channel_id = 1389999965979283608
   - ticket_log_channel_id = (specify)
   - inactivity_timeout = 30 min
Verification Logic Flow
User joins server

Bot sends verification prompt with gray Verify and blue Can’t Verify buttons (no labels)

On verify:

Trigger webhook/api call to Bloxlink (use above API key)

If success → Grant Verified, send success DM

If fail → Optionally provide error, option for Can’t Verify

On Can’t Verify:

Move user to Support channel automatically

Best Practices
Follow security/permission discipline for bots

Log all actions (verify, tickets, mod events)

Use modular config for API keys, channels, roles, timeouts

Regular bug testing on button, permissions, error re-routing

Sample Professional Rules Section for Reference

Additional Notes
No emojis (per request)

Use Discord markdown (>, code blocks, headers, horizontal lines, etc.)

All roles, channels, features must be mapped and tested before release.

No bugs or issues tolerated — test every feature.

Organize all scripts and configs for easy deployment in Replit/agent.

Copy this to your agent/replit config to begin. Expand as needed per new feature requests.

first enable agent on perplexity and check and then rewrite it for whats needed so first check

I've completed a comprehensive audit of your Spiritual Battlegrounds Discord server and created a full bot specification document.
