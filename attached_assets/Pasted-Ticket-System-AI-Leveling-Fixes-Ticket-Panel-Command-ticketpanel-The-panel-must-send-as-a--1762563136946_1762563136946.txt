Ticket System + AI + Leveling Fixes

Ticket Panel (Command: !ticketpanel)

The panel must send as a Discord embed, not plain text.

Embed design should look clean and professional, with proper markdown and spacing.

Add the notice section inside the embed (styled nicely, no emojis).

The ticket options must be a select menu, not buttons.

Ticket Options (Select Menu):

Support Ticket → Category ID: 1436498409153626213

Request CC → Category ID: 1436498445216256031

Report Player → Category ID: 1436498495153635512

Warning Appeal → Category ID: 1436498528544227428

When a ticket is created:

The channel name format must be:
《🔴》・@user → when not claimed
《🟢》・@user → when claimed

Only the user and the ticket manager should see the channel.

At the top of the ticket channel, it should display an embed like this:

> Ticket opened by @user
> Reason:


Then below that, show the reason the user gave in a formatted code block like this:
Reason: example text here

The user’s Roblox avatar should appear small on the right side of the embed (thumbnail size), and the name should be clickable — linking to their Roblox profile.

When the ticket is claimed, the bot should not reply with text — just edit the ticket’s top embed to include:

> This ticket has been claimed by @user


in a new field.

When the ticket is closed, it should automatically send the transcript (with staff name and user) to channel ID 1420538005936013403.

Fix the “This is not a valid ticket channel.” issue — closing should work in all valid ticket channels.

AI Chat System:

The AI still says “AI chat is currently disabled.” — fix this so it’s fully functional.

When pinged, the AI should reply naturally in chat.

Make /aisetup actually activate the AI.

The AI should be built-in and work for general conversation.

It should also use memory for short-term context (remembering the last few messages).

Level System Fix:

The leveling system is stuck at level 3.

Fix it so it starts from Level 1 and increases properly as users chat.

For example:

After ~20 messages → Level 1

Then continues to Level 2, Level 3, etc.

When a user levels up, send a plain text message (no embed) in channel ID 1409304816718709006, like:

@user has reached Level 2! Keep chatting to earn more levels!


General Requirements:

All embeds and panels must look clean and well-structured using Discord markdown.

No duplicate messages.

No unnecessary replies from the bot — it should only send embeds or structured responses.

Everything must function smoothly with zero bugs or issues.
