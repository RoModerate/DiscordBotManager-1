Teaching System Fix
- The bot should only trigger when the exact taught phrase (or a close variant) is detected, not just the first word.
- Example:
  Wrong: Triggered on "what"
  Correct: Only triggers on "what is spiritual battlegrounds" or "what is spiritual battlegrounds?"
- The teaching command format should be:
  !teach [trigger] [response]
  Example: 
  !teach what is spiritual battlegrounds? Spiritual Battlegrounds is a Roblox Battlegrounds game based on the anime "Dan Da Dan" that focuses on exciting combat and community engagement.

2. Unteach Command
- When running !unteach [trigger], the bot should remove the entire entry based on the trigger name (not ID numbers unless specified).
- Example: !unteach what is spiritual battlegrounds removes that exact trained response.

3. AI Response Clean-up
- The bot should never repeat the user’s question back in the response.
- Example:
  Wrong: "What is Spiritual Battlegrounds? Spiritual Battlegrounds is..."
  Correct: "Spiritual Battlegrounds is a Roblox Battlegrounds game based on the anime 'Dan Da Dan' and it’s made to engage the community."

4. Command Example Behavior
User: !teach @Spiritual the game is about an anime named DanDaDan  
Bot: Taught successfully. When users ask something related to "the game", I’ll respond with:  
"The game is based on the anime DanDaDan."

Then, when someone says:
User: what is the game about?  
Bot: The game is based on the anime DanDaDan.

5. Reply Filters
- The bot should only respond to messages that:
  - Mention its trigger or prefix (! or @Spiritual)
  - Contain the exact or close trained trigger phrase
  - Are not commands (skip generic messages like "yo", "hi", or "I need help" unless taught)

6. Context Check
- If someone asks a question that isn’t trained, respond with:
  "I’m not taught about that yet. You can teach me with:  
  !teach [question] [answer]"

7. No Random Responses
- The bot should not invent or generate unrelated replies. Stick only to:
  - Trained data
  - Approved fallback responses (like "not taught yet")

8. Optional Enhancements
- Add timestamp to successful teach and unteach confirmations:
  Example:
  Bot trained successfully at 9:36 PM  
  Response removed at 9:41 PM
